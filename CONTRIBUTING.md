# Contributing to Nuenv

Feel free to:

- [File issues][issues]
- Open [pull requests][prs]
  - For opening new PRs, please:
    - Write your commit messages using [conventional commits][cc]. This allows:
      - Releasing new versions easier and more reliably.
      - Easier way to search through previous history.
      - Easier to follow and read PRS, meaning it is more likely to get merged in faster.
    - Try to keep unrelated changes into separate PRs. I prefer smaller, quick-to-review PRs.
- Participate in [discussions]
